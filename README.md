# dotfiles
should be included: 
- kitty term with MonaLisa theme 
- nvim with gruvbox-material and other common plugins(theprimeagen video config 
- with a diferent theme and COLEMAK keybidings) 
- i3 with default polybar 
- Lexsa and lemonade font https://www.sainnhe.dev/post/patch-fonts-with-cursive-italic-styles/
- rofi
- neovim is referenced in the zshrc file as "alias vim='~/Documents/./squashfs-root/usr/bin/nvim'", neovim is also contained in the dotfiles \
that is done because in most apt distros its very outdated(contained version is 9.1)

todo: 
- remove useless files and directories: done
- make an install stcript, since im a certified linux distro breaker(fuck nvidia drivers)
